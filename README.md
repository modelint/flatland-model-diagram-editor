This repo is the deprecated and no longer supported version of Flatland.

Please go to the 'flatland' repository here at modelint for a completely rebuilt and greatly improved version!

Here are the new links:

https://github.com/modelint/flatland

https://github.com/modelint/flatland/wiki

https://pypi.org/project/mi-flatland/2.0.0/

(I have transferred all of the potentially unresolved issues to the new repo 25-1-14 / LS)
